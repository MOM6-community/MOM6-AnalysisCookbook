The external quantities include the vertical component of planetary vorticity $f=2\\Omega \\sin \\phi$ and the gravitational potential $\\Phi = g \\, z$.  Finally, $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is the acceleration due to the divergence of stresses including those provided through boundary interactions."

MOM6 then provides particular space and time discretizations of accelerations from the local time derivative, Coriolis, nonlinear vorticity, remapping, pressure, friction, boundaries. We are not concerned here with details for how the terms are discretized. Rather, we articulate the diagnostic terms required to close the velocity budget over a grid cell, and to identify where further diagnostics need to be coded. The table below summarizes these diagnostics and the tasks needed to close the budget.\n",

    "1. An online diagnostic for vertical remapping term $w^{(\\dot{s})} \\, \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial z}$ is currently not available in MOM6. Nethertheless, this term is expected to be small in comparison to other diagnostic terms. We confirm this when we anlyze plots of momentum budget terms later in this tutorial. \n",
    "2. The contribution due to linear Coriolis term $- \\left[ \\frac{f}{h} \\right] \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\wedge (h \\, \\mathbf{u})$ can be computed as  `CAu - rvxv - gKEu`, `CAv - rvxu - gKEv`.\n",
    "3. Two separate diagnostics are saved for pressure accelaration term (barotropic and baroclinic) because MOM6 uses split scheme for integrating the velocity equation in time. The net pressure force accelaration is the sum of these two diagnostics.\n",
    "4. Contribution from vertical friction, surface wind stress and bottom friction are combined into one single diagnostic. It is tricky to compute individual components. We discuss this issue in more detail later when we look at depth-averaged momentum budgets."
